        <h1>Celeste's Interesting Life</h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(163, 64, 81)">I am from Houston, Texas (like Beyonce). I have a maltipoo. Her name is Missy and she is white with black spots. She has a mix of curly and straight hair. Missy is the cutest dog alive. She is a fairly small dog. I also trained her, so I trained her as a service dog and she protects me and is like a therapy dog to make me happy when I feel sad. She is a very intelligent dog. </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(163, 64, 81)">My mom is from Mexico and my dad is part French, but is from Santa Cruz, California. I have two sisters, one older and one younger. I am EXTREMELY close to my older sister. Her name is Ariel and we have roomed together for 3 semesters now. However, the sad part is that she is graduating at the end of this semester. Also I am planning on going on a mission by the end of the summer, I have not turned in my papers yet, but I am working on it.</p>
